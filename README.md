# LMS-Algorithm-for-Noise-Cancellation
The main objective of this project is to present and simulate an adaptive filter using LMS (Least Mean
Square) for noise cancellation. The method estimates signal corrupted by additive noise or interference. The primary
input contains the corrupted signal and the reference input contains noise that is correlated somehow with the
primary noise. The algorithm minimizes the mean squared error of cost function trying to converge in least mean
square sense to the optimal Wiener-Hopf solution to filter the noise from the signal.
